title: RoadMap - Bongo

<p>Milestones below are used to break the path to 1.0 down into significant feature developments: it is intended that each milestone represents a discrete piece of achievable work, so that progress can continue to be made.

<h3>Release strategy:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>source code releases at M1, M2 and M4 as "alpha" or "developer-only" releases of code known to mostly work.</li>
	<li>preview releases at M3 and M5. These will consist of a source release, and possibly static binary release for GNU-ish OSes.</li>
	<li>beta release programme TBA from M6-ish onwards, leading to 1.0 release.</li>

</ul>
<p>No dates are yet determined on the schedule below: these can only be realistically set when we see how long it takes us to get to M1!</p>

<p>There may also be overlap between the different milestones, in terms of features for later milestones appearing in some form earlier (but not later).</p>
