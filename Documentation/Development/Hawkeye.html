<h3>Bongo 1.0 Administration Interface</h3>
<p>This will be a simple web UI, similar in look to Dragonfly(?), and based on the same "technology" (the same framework).</p>
<p>This spec doesn't cover the CLI UI.</p>
<b>Features:</b>
<ul>
	<li>manage users on the system
		<ul>
			<li>add, remove users</li>
			<li>change user preferences(?) (use case: support)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>manage hosted domains to receive e-mail</li>
	<li>ability to turn agents on and off</li>
	<li>able to configure key agent functionality, e.g.:
		<ul>
			<li>SMTP, IMAP, POP3 ports</li>
			<li>whether or not secure services are used</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>able to manage secure services:
		<ul>
			<li>can generate a new certificate</li>
			<li>can load an existing (non-snake-oil?) certificate</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>tells the admin when a restart is needed for config to take effect (I suspect we ''don't'' want instant apply type tech here)</li>
	<li>ability to restart the Bongo system from the UI
		<ul>
			<li>ability to stop / start system in general (?)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>get basic stats on the system: e-mails being processed, load on the system</li>
	<li>ability to view some logs</li>
</ul>
