<h1>Avocado</h1>
<p>Avocado is the web UI, intended to replace <a href="{{url}}/Documentation/Development/Dragonfly.html">Dragonfly</a>. <a href="{{url}}/Documentation/Development/Crystal.html">Crystal</a> makes up the server backend, and the core Javascript bits.</p>

<h2>Core plugins</h2>

<p>As Avocado is modular in design, the core of Avocado would only contain the interfaces and API, as well as a GUI skeleton. The following plugins would be available together with the core Avocado release to provide some sort of functionality to the end user:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Mail</li>
	<li>Calendar</li>
	<li>Summary</li>
	<li>Contacts</li>
	<li>Instant Messaging</li>
</ol>
