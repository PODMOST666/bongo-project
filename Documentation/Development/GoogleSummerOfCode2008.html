title: Google Summer Of Code 2008 - Bongo

<h1>Google SoC Student application</h1>

<p>This is our proposed application form for students applying to the Bongo Project.</p>

<h2>Name & Contact Details</h2>

<p>Please provide your contact details: at the minimum, a name and e-mail address.</p> 

<ul>
	<li>Name:</li>
	<li>E-mail:</li>
	<li>Address/location:</li>

</ul>

<h2>A Short Bio</h2>

<p>Please tell us a little about yourself. In particular, what you're studying (and how far into your course you are), and detail any previous experience in the free software community or participation in a free software project.</p>

<p>The Bongo Project prides itself on fun and friendliness: as well as technically adept students, we also want people who will fit our culture. So, remember, we're not just interested in your technical skills, but also your "people skills".</p>

<h2>Your Proposal</h2>

<p>What would you like to do? Please give us a high-level description (what functionality and/or end-user use cases you're addressing) and a more detailed technical discussion (protocols that might be implemented, for example). Point out which areas you have existing knowledge and/or experience, and which areas will be novel either for you, for the Bongo Project, or present novel ideas/functionality in general. What technical skills would you use doing the project, and what skills would you gain?</p>

<p>Outline a project plan as best you can. This should begin with a period of some research and planning, end with a brief project report, and have a number of stages in between by which progress can be measured. Goals should be simple and measurable. If you have specific dates in mind, please include them.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Why should we pick this proposal? We want the best students, and the best ideas - what makes you the ideal combination?</p>

<p>Ideally, your participation in Bongo would begin before your project starts, and we hope that you would continue to participate well after your project finishes.  However, nothing is guaranteed - if your participation finished with the project, how would your contribution live on?</p>
