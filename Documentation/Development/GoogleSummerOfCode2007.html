<H1> Google SoC mentor application </H1>

The required application should follow the 17 points listed in <a href="http://code.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=60303&topic=10727"> Google FAQ </a>

<h3>Google Soc Ideas</h3>

<p>You can list here ideas that would be nice Summer of Code. Remember : an idea must be about 3 months of work for a single contributor. So, not too big, not too small, we only want a shruberry !</p>

<p>If you want to apply to SoC as a student for a given idea, put your email beside it with the name of the mentor (if any, no required).</p>


 <p>* It would be nice if Bongo could make coffee...</p>
