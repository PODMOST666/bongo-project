<h1>Architecture</h1>

<p>Bongo is made up of several components:<p>
<ul>
	<li>Core libraries (msgapi, etc)</li>
	<li>Core binaries/utilities (bongo-manager, bongo-config, ...)</li>
	<li>Agents (bongosmtp, bongoimap, ...)</li>
	<li><a href="{{url}}/Documentation/Development/Hawkeye.html">Hawkeye - Admin interface</a></li>
	<li><a href="{{url}}/Documentation/Development/Dragonfly.html">Dragonfly</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A diagram showing the relationship between these components would be awesome here.</p>
