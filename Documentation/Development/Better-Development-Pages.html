<h2>Better Development Area</h2>

<p>At the moment, if you look at our <a href="{{url}}/Documentation/Development.html">Development</a> area, you'll see there's a fair amount of information (though, plenty is missing), and not an awful lot of order.</p>

<h3>What's needed is two-fold:</h3> 
<ul>
	<li>Someone to look at the stuff in the area, and come up with some kind of plan for making it more accessible.</li>
	<li>Maybe you could start Development Proposal or something, create a prototype, and see what people think of it, based on the plan.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The primary audience here is likely going to be a few different types of people:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Existing contributors (who likely know their way around a bit better)</li>
	<li>New contributors to the Bongo Project</li>
	<li>Third-party developers who want to integrate with Bongo.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the moment, we cater reasonably well to 1, a bit to 2, and not at all to 3. We also group things "logically", but don't really address those separate use cases. Existing contributors should know their way around whatever we do, so they should probably come bottom of the list - we mainly need to hit the other two types of people.
