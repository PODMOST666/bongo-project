<h1>Bongo Love!</h1>

<p>What is "Bongo Love"? Simply, a set of bugs in our software or project that we think are easy to fix, and that are perfect for someone who wants to contribute to Bongo for the first time. You don't have to be a coder, and you don't even need to know what you're doing - simply drop by on IRC and tell us which Love Bug you'd like to have a go at!</p>

<p>First, you will probably find the <a href="">Getting Involved</a> pages very useful for all the contact information. Our <a href="">Development</a> area also has good documentation about various parts of the system.
</p>
<h2>Love Bugs</h2> 

<p>Without further ado, here are the current Love Bugs. Again, if you'd like to have a go at one, the best thing to do would be to drop by on IRC and tell us what you're going to try to do, and we can then give you any further help you might need.</p>

		<td>At the moment, our development wiki is a bit hodge-podge. It could do with being clear up.</td>

		<td>Revise NMLIB documentation</td>
		<td>Our NMLIB code is documented, but doesn't use doxygen! We need someone to lightly rework what already exists.</td>
