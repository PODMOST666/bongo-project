<h1>Dragonfly Info</h1>

<p>Dragonfly is Bongo's web interface, providing Bongo users with access to their mail, events, and contacts from any modern web browser.</p>

<h2>Supported Browsers</h2>

<p>The Bongo Project aims to officially support: </p>
<ol>
	<li>[http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/ Firefox] 1.5 and higher,</li>
	<li>[http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/ Safari] 2.0 and higher,</li>
	<li>[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ Internet Explorer] 6.0 and higher,</li>
</ol>
<p>or any software that embeds the engines behind these browsers.  It is written to web standards and other standards-compliant browsers will most likely work.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Dynamic Interface</h3>

<p>Dragonfly features a dynamic interface that combines the interactivity of desktop applications with the convenience and connectivity of web applications.  Instead of waiting for pages to reload, users can access features instantly and continue using Hula as changes are saved in the background.</p>

<h3>Tight Integration</h3>
<p>Dragonfly integrates mail and calendar features into a unified interface.  The summary tab shows new email and upcoming events in a single view.  Invitations that arrive by mail can be added to the calendar right from the mail message.  Likewise, invitations to events can be sent right from the calendar. This integration extends to search as well.  The full text of mail, events, and contacts can be searched from a single location.</p>

<h3>Conversational Approach to Mail</h3>
<p>Dragonfly's mail interface groups connected mail messages into conversations.  The conversational approach reduces clutter by grouping related messages into a single heading, whether in the inbox or in search results.</p>

<p>Search is the primary method of accessing archived mail, and Hula provides full-text search of the entire mail store.  In addition to text search, it is also possible to search for mail conversations based on participant: one click finds all the mail which a particular person participated in, regardless of how may email addresses they use. </p>

<h3>Rich Calendar Features</h3>

<p>In addition to being a fully functional mail client, Dragonfly provides a full calendar interface as well with daily, upcoming, weekly, and monthly views of events.  Due to its dynamic interface, users can create and edit events directly on the calendar views, even using desktop metaphors like drag and drop to move an event to a new date and time.  The Quick Event feature allows users to add an event in an English sentence, such as "Dinner with Jessica tomorrow at 6."</p>

<p>Since Hula uses the iCalendar standard, Dragonfly users can easily subscribe to web calendars and publish their own calendars for others.  Users on the same hula server can even edit one another's calendars.  </p>
