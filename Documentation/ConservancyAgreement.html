title: Conservancy Agreement - Bongo
---
<p>The following text was given to use by the Software Freedom Conservancy, and explains the various sections of the agreement we would need to formally accept to join the Conservancy.</p>

<a href="{{url}}/Documentation/ConservancyAgreementText.html">The actual legalese</a>

<h2>Introductory Paragraph</h2>

<p>This paragraph identifies the parties to the contract.  It's more
thoroughly explained in paragraph 6, but the point of this paragraph is
to name the people who sign the agreement.</p>

<h2>Recitals (the "WHEREAS" section)</h2>

<p>These paragraphs set forth the basic understandings of the parties.
Similar to the "preamble" found in the GPL and other Free Software
licenses, these are not operative provisions of the document.  Instead,
they give the context of the agreement.</p>

<p>In this specific case, the key points of understanding are that the
purpose of Bongo is to forward FOSS and that both the Conservancy and
Bongo want Bongo to join the Conservancy.  The Conservancy's
mission (and charitable purpose) is to advance only FOSS development, so
it is important that this context be stated clearly.</p>

<h2>Paragraph 1 - Term of Agreement</h2>

<p>This paragraph says that Bongo is part of the Conservancy as of the
signing date of the agreement.  It cross references the terminations
provisions in paragraph 7 (which is explained in greater detail below).
Note, though, that Bongo  can choose to leave the Conservancy at any
time.</p>

<h2>Paragraph 2 - Project Management and Activities</h2>

<h3>Section A)</h3>

<p>Both parties agree that Bongo will be FOSS.  As noted above, this is
the fundamental goal and charitable purpose of the Conservancy.  The
Conservancy will not sponsor proprietary projects.</p>

<h3>Section B)</h3>

<p>This clearly sets out the limits of the Conservancy's management over
Bongo.  Due to requirements connected to the tax exempt status that
the Conservancy is seeking to achieve, the ultimate legal control of
the projects must be in the hands of the Conservancy.  From the IRS's
perspective, the projects compose the Conservancy, and the purpose of
its tax exemption is to forward the FOSS mission of those projects.</p>

<p>However, the Conservancy does not want to interfere with the successful
software development work already underway in member projects; such
activity should continue after the agreement without interruption or
interference.  This paragraph delegates part of the Conservancy's legal
authority back to the developers, so that Bongo can run itself in
day-to-day matters.</p>

<p>The only limitations that we must place are to prevent Bongo from
producing non-free software (as per the Conservancy's charitable
purpose) and from spending money or conducting activities that would
jeopardize the Conservancy's tax exempt status.  All the ordinary
activities of FOSS projects come well within these limitations.  Some
specific activities that are restricted include lobbying activities and
spending money in ways other than consistent with the charitable
purposes of the Conservancy (i.e., forwarding FOSS).</p>

<p>Note that developers of Bongo, in their capacity as individuals (when
not representing Bongo), still may engage in for-profit service
businesses related to their Free Software work.  The work of Bongo
itself must fit the guidelines, but individuals are free to act in
their own capacity in other endeavors.</p>

<p>If you are ever concerned that a particular activity -- be it one
carried out for Bongo or one that an individual developer engaged in
independently -- might be a problem, you can always ask the Conservancy's
lawyers for clarification.</p>

<h3>Section C)</h3>

<p>As discussed above in (b), this section describes the corporate
relationship of the project and the Conservancy.  For clarity, it
refers to section (b), which delegates the actual management of Bongo
to the relevant developers.  The Conservancy, when acting as a fiscal
sponsor, must have the legal authority to manage Bongo, even though
section (b) delegates the day-to-day operations to the developers.</p>

<h3>Section D)</h3>

<p>This section clarifies that Bongo can't represent the Conservancy
without getting written authorization first.  If you'd like to
represent the Conservancy at a conference or other such event, you can
always talk to us about it.</p>

<h2>Paragraph 3 - No Fees</h2>

<p>It's just as it sounds.  The Conservancy provides services to projects to
benefit the Free Software community and does not ask member projects to
bear the overhead costs. Of course, projects are welcome to make
donations to the Conservancy if they desire.</p>

<h2>Paragraph 4 - Project Fund/Variance Power</h2>

<p>This sets out the financial structure in connection with the relationship
described above in paragraph 2. The Conservancy will maintain a separate
bank account for Bongo and, for tax purposes, the Conservancy will
report all of the income to Bongo in its IRS filings.  Bongo therefore
will not need to file any separate tax returns with the IRS.  The
Conservancy will keep the financial books for Bongo.  The developers
will direct the Conservancy to spend the money on behalf of Bongo,
within the limitations imposed by the tax laws.  The Conservancy will
receive any checks on behalf of Bongo, and it will also write checks on
behalf of Bongo.</p>

<h2>Paragraph 5 - Project Fund Management/Performance of Charitable Purposes</h2>

<p>This paragraph clarifies that all assets will be devoted to the project's
purposes, as those purposes are a subset of the Conservancy's purposes.
Assets cannot be used in connection with activities that would jeopardize
the Conservancy's tax exempt status.  As discussed above, in practice,
most typical expenses of FOSS projects will come well within these
limitations.  Activities that are restricted include lobbying activities
and spending money in ways other than consistent with the charitable
purposes of the conservancy (i.e., forwarding FOSS).</p>

<h2>Paragraph 6 - Representation of the Project in the Conservancy</h2>

<p>As the note in this section indicates, we understand that each project
will have its own management structure that it has developed to reflect
its size and community.  This paragraph requires that certain
representatives be named as the individuals that can officially
communicate decisions on behalf of Bongo.  This can be a single
maintainer, a committee of developers or a few specified representatives.
To the extent that it makes sense for Bongo to have a committee of
representatives, we should indicate how decisions can be made by that
committee.  For example, should all decisions be communicated to the
conservancy by all members of the committee or would a simple majority
suffice?  Can any one representative communicate official decisions on
behalf of all?  Bongo should also consider adding a mechanism here for
adding and removing representatives over time.  We're happy to discuss
methods that have worked for other projects with you to help you select
the solution that is right for you.</p>

<h2>Paragraph 7 - Outstanding Liabilities</h2>

<p>In this section, Bongo confirms that it has told the Conservancy about
any liabilities that might be outstanding prior to joining the
Conservancy. This gives the Conservancy some assurance that its due
diligence process has been complete and that the Conservancy's board
received all of the information it needed to properly evaluate the project.
Liabilities include, for example, financial obligations, such as any debts
or outstanding bills, or any legal claims that could be outstanding against
Bongo.</p>

<h2>Paragraph 8 - Termination</h2>

<p>Projects can leave the Conservancy at will.  This section sets out the
mechanisms for termination to make sure that when a project leaves the
Conservancy it does so without jeopardizing the tax exempt status of the
Conservancy (and, consequently, the status of all of the other projects in
the Conservancy).</p>

<p>There is a 60 day notice requirement so that a new tax exempt
non-profit can be found for Bongo to join.  If there isn't another
fiscal sponsor or other tax exempt non-profit to take over Bongo,
Bongo can incorporate as a separate entity and apply for tax exemption
recognition.  If there is no separate entity -- for example if a project
loses momentum and has been abandoned by its developers -- the Conservancy
must be left with the assets for use by the Conservancy for other
FOSS-related charitable work.</p>

<p>These restrictions would also apply to any separate tax exempt entity, so
if Bongo were to incorporate and achieve tax exemption outside of the
Conservancy, it would have to deal with the same considerations upon any
wind-up or distribution of assets.  Members of the Conservancy's board are
familiar with non-profit wind-down situations, and can assist in
the unlikely event that this unfortunate outcome occurs.</p>

<h2>Paragraph 9 - Miscellaneous</h2>

<p>These provisions are standard agreement boilerplate - they clarify the
enforceability of separate provisions, specify that the contract be
governed by New York Law and state that any amendments to this agreement
need to be agreed to in writing by all of the parties.</p>

<h2>Paragraph 10 - Counterparts/Facsimile</h2>

<p>Although it's good to have original signatures in the corporate records,
this allows you to simply sign the signature page and fax or scan a copy
for the contract to take effect.</p>
